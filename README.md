Some important files / information about my projects

# README

# LICENSE
Some of my projects hold a `license.md` file which the MD only means it's a markdown supported type of file. This just means that the documentation is easier to read over-all. The license is for new creators that do impressive things or long term creators who have their contact stolen most of the time. The license just implies that you can strike the "stealers" work and that you have all credit back to what is right-fully yours. This license may update over-time. If it does you will be notified in this repo. A updated version of the repo will then also release.
